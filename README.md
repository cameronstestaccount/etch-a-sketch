# Etch-a-Sketch

## Description
This project will use a combination of html, css, and javascript to produce a wepbage that can be drawn on similar to the etch-a-sketch toy

This will be done using a grid of divs that change color when hovered over with the mouse, leaving a trail behind. The user can press a button at the top to reset the grid and enter new dimensions for the grid size.
